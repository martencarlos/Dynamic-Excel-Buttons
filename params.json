{"name":"Excel-button","tagline":"VBA code that creates two buttons dynamically when specific listener cells are populated.","body":"### Automatic Excel button generation\r\n\r\nI'm starting to work more seriously with Excel files and have encountered a big frustration when I wanted to create a button that, when pressed opened a word document. As it turns out it requires quite a bit of coding.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I decided to go through the process of creating a robust and standard way to create buttons in Excel, and posted on Github so that anyone who feels the same need and has the expertise can contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nTo get this feature, simply download the latest version of the Excel file from the Releases tab. Once you open the file there will be instructions and tips on how to create the buttons.\r\n\r\nI really hope this helps you with your frustration of creating buttons in Excel :)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFor Now, I @martencarlos am the only one that contributed to the project and will be tweaking it as the feedback comes in. If someone contributes to it, I'll be sure to mention you in this page. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you are having any trouble with the Macro-enabled Excel Template File or have any questions about the code, feel free to let me know.
